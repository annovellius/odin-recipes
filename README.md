# Odin Recipes Project
This is the first project on my learning journey with the Odin Project
and it involves using recipes as an avenue to gain experience working
with html headings, relataive links, and lists (both ordered and 
unordered). This project was an excellent refresher for me to begin
working with html again, and I learned a lot about how to use the
Linux terminal to interact with git and GitHub. Using a version control
software has been life-changing for me, and I absolutely look forward
to learning more about it so I can better utilize it for other personal
projects in the future.
